<h2>Tools</h2>
<ul>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Fusion 360</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This project was created to generate valid 5 gear watch trains given physical values such as module, pin diameter, escapement wheels, beats per hour and teeth number. All calculations are based on <a href="https://archive.org/details/practicalcoursei00kellrich" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>A Practical Course in Horology</i></a>. By using Java I was able to create tens of unique options for gear trains quickly and accurately. The Clock Maker project started out as a way to make a functioning mechanical clock with laser cutting. Fusion 360'2 built-in gear generator and 3D to svg conversion made it an easy choice when it comes to modeling. Although no physical clock was made, the gears ran as expected in simulations. The gears follow the basic structure as seen below. </p>
